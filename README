This tree contains source to generate a version of the sysio 
library, called libsysiox.a, which can be used to link apps 
intended for execution on a standard Linux node. 

This library shares some of the source code in the libsysio 
tree using VPATH, thus the libsysio source must be present 
in order to build it.

To build libsysiox.a, run:

./autogen.sh
./configure [options]
make

Option --with-sysio-src=<dir> allows the path to the libsysio 
source to be specified. Default is ../libsysio.

Option --with-tests=<yes|no> enables/disables build in the test 
subdirectory. Default is yes.

Option --with-emulation=<yes|no> enables/disables use of a local 
set of dummy wrappers for aio calls. Default is yes.
